                Hello, my name is <b>Christina Raganit</b>!
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am a graduate from the Computer Systems Technology program at
                British Columbia Institute of Technology and I am currently in
                my second year studying for my Bachelor of Arts in Interactive
                Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am currently the UI/UX designer for British Columbia-based
                startup Karma Well Health Technologies. We build products
                seeking to help people in their wellness journeys. My favourite
                part of the job is learning something new on Figma, ideating
                with the brightest minds I've ever had the pleasure of meeting,
                and being in an environment that celebrates my authenticity and
                creativity.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am also a frontend developer. Some of my favourite
                technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the
                Material UI library. Most of my projects are in Google Firebase
                and I primarily use GitHub for version control. I am currently
                learning Angular, and hope to learn Vue.js and React Native as
                well.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am also a graphic designer. I began my journey eight years ago
                when I started learning Photoshop at the age of twelve (a very
                tall order for a twelve-year-old, if I have to admit). I loved
                escaping to fantasy landscapes using photomanipulation! My
                favourite design tools for graphic design include Adobe
                Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe After Effects.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am also a writer and a storyteller. I dream of one day being a
                published author. I write novels about feminist heroines in a
                wide variety of settings, from kingdoms of magic and dragons to
                technological wonderlands set in the future.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                I am passionate about creating â€“ whether it's building websites,
                writing stories, or making user interfaces, I love it all! My
                dream job would allow me to continue learning, continue
                creating, and never stop doing. One of my favourite experiences
                in my career included working as a development support for FIFA
                21, and ever since then, I learned that I wanted to create
                something that will be enjoyed and loved by many. That is the
                legacy that I want to leave behind in this world.
              </p>

              <p className="Body">
                With that being said, I am an avid gamer with hundreds of hours
                on my two favourite video games, League of Legends and Teamfight
                Tactics. I am a Platinum 4 Seraphine main and a Hyper Roll
                enjoyer whose highest rank is Diamond 1 95 LP on Set 4.5 for
                regular Ranked play. (Thank you, 6-Keeper Kennen/Xayah comp!)

                lobbies!

              <p className="Body">
                What's my fixation with stars, you might be wondering? During a
                time in my life where I felt the most lost, I turned to video
                games for comfort. I met amazing new friends and gained a
                confidence in myself and developed a certainty for myself that
                I'm capable in my own right. There's a quote that I heard once
                when playing Braum on League of Legends that changed my outlook
                in life, "The darker the night, the brighter the stars." Ever
                since then, my in-game username and online persona became
                Astris, which derives from the Latin word for star, <i>astra</i>
                . Even in the darkest times, I knew I would one day shine... or
                burn bright trying.
              </p>
